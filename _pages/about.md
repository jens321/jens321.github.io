My main research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Prior to this, I have also explored projects in interpretability and AI for Climate. 


**Bio**: I studied Computer Science at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu), where I was fortunate to work with Professor [Sameer Singh](http://sameersingh.org/). Now, I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the Princeton NLP group.
