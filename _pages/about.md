I am currently part of the <a href="http://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/">Princeton NLP</a> group, where I am advised by Professor [Karthik Narasimhan](https://karthikncode.github.io). My research focuses on building decision-making agents, mainly using ideas from reinforcement learning (RL) and natural language processing (NLP). 


**Bio**: I studied Computer Science and Engineering at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu), where I was fortunate to work with Professor [Sameer Singh](http://sameersingh.org/) on interpretability in NLP, and with Professor [Stephan Mandt](https://www.stephanmandt.com) and Professor [Mike Pritchard](https://sites.ps.uci.edu/pritchard/) on AI for climate. Now, I'm a 5th year PhD student in the Princeton NLP group.
